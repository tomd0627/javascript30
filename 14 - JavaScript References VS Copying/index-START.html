      // however what happens when we update that array?

      // now here is the problem!

      // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

      // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

      // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

      // one way
      const team2 = players.slice();

      // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

      const person = {
        name: "Wes Bos",
        age: 80,
      };

      // and think we make a copy:
      // const captain = person;
      // captain.number = 99;
      // console.log(person);

      // how do we take a copy instead?
      const captain2 = Object.assign([], person, { number: 99 });
      console.log(captain2);

      // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

      // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
